# TY Workshop Spotify App - StudentGuide

# 🎵 Spotify Search Mini-Project  
A beginner-friendly web project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Spotify Web API.

Today you're building your very own **mini Spotify search engine**.  
Your task is to complete the code so that a user can type in a song name, click **Find**, and see six Spotify track results displayed as cards on the page.

This README provides guidance and hints — **but not solutions**.

But first… you’ve got some quests to complete.  
Let’s go! 🚀🎧

## 🎯 What You're Building  

By the end of this project, your page will:

- Let users search for any song on Spotify  
- Show six tracks in tidy little cards  
- Display album art, song names, artist names, and a link to listen  
- Look clean and stylish with Bootstrap  
- Feel like a real mini-app, not just a school task ❤️

---

## 📁 What You Start With  

Inside your project, you’ll find:

- **HTML** — the skeleton  
- **CSS** — the outfit  
- **JavaScript** — the brain (a very tiny one, but still smart!)  

Some bits are missing on purpose, that's your job!

Copy and paste everything into a new JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/

## 🧩 Your Quests  

### ⭐ Quest 1: Give the page a proper heading  
There’s a big empty spot screaming “PUT A TITLE HERE”.  
Fill it with something cool.

---

### ⭐ Quest 2: Make the Find button fabulous  
Use a Bootstrap button style to make it pop.  
(It’s currently naked. Help it.)

---

### ⭐ Quest 3: Clone the song card  
You have **1** card.  
You need **6**.  
Use the same pattern of IDs and make five more little cards.  
Go forth and multiply.

---

### ⭐ Quest 4: Grab the search text  
Your JavaScript needs to read whatever the user types into the search bar.  
That text becomes your search query.

---

### ⭐ Quest 5: Hide the "placeholder" message  
Once you show results, the placeholder message is no longer needed.  
Make it vanish like ✨poof✨.

---

### ⭐ Quest 6: Fill in all six song cards  
The first card already has the logic to get song data.  
Your mission: repeat that process for tracks 1–5.

You’ll need:

- The song’s name  
- The artist’s name  
- The album image  
- The link to play the song  

They’re all tucked inside the API response.  
Follow the pattern — everything matches nicely.

Bonus hint: the card IDs and the data indexes line up perfectly. 😎

---

### ⭐ Quest 7: Reveal the results section  
The results area is hidden at first.  
Once everything is ready, show it dramatically.  
*Cue spotlight.*

## 💡 Helpful Hints  

- All six cards follow the exact same structure — use that to your advantage  
- Loops can save your life (and your sanity)  
- Make sure your IDs in HTML match what your JavaScript expects  
- Bootstrap can help you make things look awesome with very little effort  
- Test your page every time you finish a quest

---

## 🌟 Bonus Challenges (Optional but fun!)  

If you finish early and want extra glory:

- Add a loading spinner that appears while searching  
- Show a friendly message if the search box is empty  
- Add a message if Spotify returns no results  
- Animate the cards so they fade or slide into view  
- Add a fun background or themed styling  

Your creativity = your superpower.

- APIs  
- JavaScript DOM manipulation  
- Using Bootstrap  
- Making things dynamic and interactive
