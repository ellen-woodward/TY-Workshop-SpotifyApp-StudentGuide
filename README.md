# TY Workshop Spotify App - StudentGuide

# 🎵 Spotify Search Mini-Project  

A beginner-friendly web project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Spotify Web API.

Your task is to complete the code so that a user can type in a song name, click **Find**, and see six Spotify track results displayed as cards on the page.

This README provides guidance and hints — **but not solutions**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

In this project, you will:

- Build a simple search interface  
- Use JavaScript to call the Spotify API  
- Dynamically display song cards using data returned from the API  
- Show album artwork, artist names, and links to Spotify  
- Practice DOM manipulation, loops, and JSON handling  

---

## 📁 Files in This Project  

You are provided with:

- An HTML file containing the page structure  
- A CSS file containing styles  
- A JavaScript file that asks Spotify for data and updates the page  

Some areas in each file are intentionally incomplete for you to finish.

---

## 🧠 What You Need to Complete  

### 1. Add a heading and placeholder text  
The HTML contains areas marked for you to add your own heading and some introductory text.

---

### 2. Style the Find button using Bootstrap  
Use any Bootstrap button class you like to make the button stand out.

---

### 3. Create five additional song cards  
You have one completed song card.  
You must create five more — each with its own unique set of IDs following the same pattern.

---

### 4. Get the search query from the input box  
In the JavaScript, retrieve the text the user typed and use it as your search query.

---

### 5. Hide the placeholder when results appear  
When displaying results, remove or hide the placeholder message so the results section becomes the focus.

---

### 6. Fill in all six cards with the API data  
The project shows you how to populate the first card using Spotify data.  
You must repeat the same logic for the remaining five cards.

Hints:

- Use the same index numbers as the card IDs  
- Each track contains a name, artist, album image, and a Spotify link  
- The pattern used in the first card should guide the rest  

---

### 7. Show the results section after loading data  
Once all data is ready, make sure the results container becomes visible.

---

## 💡 Helpful Hints & Tips  

- All track data follows the same structure, so repeating the logic for each card will be straightforward  
- Consider using a loop to avoid repeating your code six times  
- Bootstrap utility classes can help make the layout cleaner and more responsive  
- Make sure your element IDs match your JavaScript exactly  
- Work step-by-step and test frequently  

---

## 🎯 Stretch Challenges (Optional)  

If you finish early, try adding:

- A loading spinner that appears while searching  
- A message when the search box is empty  
- A message when no tracks are found  
- Animations when cards appear  
- Extra styling using Bootstrap  

---

## 📌 Final Notes  

This project will help you practice:

- Fetching data from an API  
- Updating the DOM dynamically  
- Using Bootstrap for styling  
- Structuring a small web application  
- Reading and understanding JSON data
